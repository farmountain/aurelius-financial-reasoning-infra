# Broker Simulator Crate

## Sprint 1 Status: **PLACEHOLDER**

This crate will provide broker simulation for order execution including:
- Market order execution
- Fill generation
- Order matching logic
- Deterministic execution with seeded RNG

## Planned for Sprint 2+

This crate is fully implemented but excluded from Sprint 1 workspace to maintain a minimal testable skeleton. It will be added back as a workspace member in Sprint 2.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Code complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ⏸️ Not included in Sprint 1 workspace

To use this crate in development, temporarily add it to the workspace members in the root `Cargo.toml`.
