# CRV Verifier Crate

## Sprint 1 Status: **PLACEHOLDER**

This crate will provide Correctness, Robustness, and Validation suite for backtest verification including:
- Bias detection (lookahead, survivorship)
- Metric validation (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
- Policy constraint enforcement
- Report generation

## Planned for Sprint 2+

This crate is fully implemented but excluded from Sprint 1 workspace to maintain a minimal testable skeleton. It will be added back as a workspace member in Sprint 2.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Code complete
- ✅ Tests passing (22 tests)
- ⏸️ Not included in Sprint 1 workspace

To use this crate in development, temporarily add it to the workspace members in the root `Cargo.toml`.
