# Cost Models Crate

## Sprint 1 Status: **PLACEHOLDER**

This crate will provide cost model implementations for trading costs including:
- Commission models (fixed per share, percentage-based)
- Slippage models
- Market impact models

## Planned for Sprint 2+

This crate is fully implemented but excluded from Sprint 1 workspace to maintain a minimal testable skeleton. It will be added back as a workspace member in Sprint 2.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Code complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ⏸️ Not included in Sprint 1 workspace

To use this crate in development, temporarily add it to the workspace members in the root `Cargo.toml`.
