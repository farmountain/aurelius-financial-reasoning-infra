# HipCortex Crate

## Sprint 1 Status: **PLACEHOLDER**

This crate will provide content-addressed artifact storage for reproducibility including:
- Artifact storage with SHA-256 hashing
- Audit log and lineage tracking
- Metadata indexing
- Replay and verification

## Planned for Sprint 2+

This crate is fully implemented but excluded from Sprint 1 workspace to maintain a minimal testable skeleton. It will be added back as a workspace member in Sprint 2.

## Implementation Status

- ✅ Code complete
- ✅ Tests passing (20 tests)
- ⏸️ Not included in Sprint 1 workspace

To use this crate in development, temporarily add it to the workspace members in the root `Cargo.toml`.
